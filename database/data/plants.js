    seededSays: 'Baby\'s tears plants are thirsty plants that never like to dry out. Water it once a week and they\'ll be more than happy. If you allow your plants to dry out, you\'ll notice a dramatic wilting. Water as soon as you notice wilting, and within a day, they should recover. Like most leafy plants, Baby\'s Tears prefers bright, indirect light. It can also handle partly shady locations, but direct sunlight is out of the question as it will burn the thin, delicate foliage. As far as pruning goes, it depends on how you want the plant to look. You should always prune the dry leaves.',

Water an indoor plant until water starts draining out of the bottom of the pot. Even though they prefer full sun, they cna also handle a couple of months in dimmer conditions. A good plan is to keep them out in summer and move them indoors during the winters. Norfolk Island Pines have notoriously weak root systems. Give them regular fertiliser regularly to strengthen the roots and don\'t be afraid to stake up the tree if it needs some extra help.\n',
