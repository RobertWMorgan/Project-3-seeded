    seededSays: 'Broadleaf Lady Palms are great in most environments. Make sure to water them every 7 - 10 days to keep their soil constantly moist but never soggy! They enjoy indirect sunlight and are fine with almost all temperatures so you can place them anywhere. Just make sure to give them a bit of shade to keep them happy. They can get a little overgrown so you can prune them when they start to get too large to handle.',

The temperature of the room won\'t matter too much but their growth can be slowed down if it gets too cold. They can easily get out of hand once it\'s been growing for a while and will need cutting back.',
